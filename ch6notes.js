/*
HISTORY OF OBJECTS

Complexity can be made manageable by separating the entire program into 
small compartments isolated from each other. 

An object is a hard shell that hides the gooey complexity inside it and 
instead offers methods that present an interface through which the object
is used. 

The idea is that the interface allows the user to work with the object 
without knowing what's going inside.

Encapsulation - distinguishing between internal and external interface
